## Solar System Mobile Application

This mobile application was developed as part of a school project with the goal of representing the solar system using Augmented Reality. It uses a multitarget (image or card) that, when focused on by the mobile device’s camera, displays a three-dimensional model of planet Earth as the main image.

The application includes buttons that allow the user to switch between different 3D models, which are presented sequentially both forwards and backwards in an infinite loop. Additionally, each model change activates a corresponding audio, providing an interactive and educational experience.

The screen also shows the name of the 3D model along with relevant information about it, enriching the user’s learning.

To make the experience more interactive, the planets rotate on their own axis, simulating their real rotation according to their speed and trajectory. Furthermore, they are displayed to scale, allowing users to appreciate the size differences between them and better understand the vastness of the solar system.
